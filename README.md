## 💡 About Me

I’m a Threat Researcher mainly focusing to identify, analyze and mitigate critical vulnerabilities. I actively monitor zero days and novel threats by keeping an eye on the Open-Source Threat Intelligence (OSINT) space using various methods including leveraging the power of automation. I’m a seasoned vulnerability researcher, specializing in the development of protection signatures in Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) and Web Application Firewalls (WAF). 🧱
